Suno.com Login Automation
Project Name: Suno.com Login Automation using Playwright
Description:
This project automates the login process for Suno.com using Playwright. The script simulates a user's login flow to Suno.com, including Google login, and saves the session state for future requests, eliminating the need to manually log in every time. This automation helps streamline the interaction with the platform and facilitates seamless API access for further tasks, like song generation requests.

Features:
Automated Login: Automates the login process to Suno.com with Google authentication.
Session Management: Saves the session data in session.json after successful login, allowing reuse for future interactions without requiring a login each time.
Error Handling: Provides robust error handling, ensuring the script handles missing elements or login failures gracefully.
Extensible: The session can be used for interacting with Sunoâ€™s API endpoints (like song generation), making this script a useful starting point for further automation tasks.
Installation:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/suno-login-automation.git
cd suno-login-automation
Install dependencies:

This project requires Playwright to be installed. You can install it using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install playwright
Install Playwright browsers: Playwright requires the installation of browser binaries. Run the following command to install them:

bash
Copy code
playwright install
Configure Google login: Ensure that you have access to your Google account and that the login flow matches the automation assumptions (e.g., Google sign-in UI is consistent).

Usage:
Run the script to automate the login process:

bash
Copy code
python automate_login.py
The script will wait for the user to complete the Google login if the automatic login button is not found. Upon successful login, it saves the session as session.json in the project directory.

Use the saved session data (session.json) in further requests (e.g., song generation) as shown in Part 2 and Part 3 of this repository.

File Breakdown:
automate_login.py: Contains the Playwright script that automates the login to Suno.com.
session.json: The saved session data, used for authenticated API requests (generated after a successful login).
song_generation.py: (Optional) Script for sending requests to generate a song using the saved session and access token.
status_check.py: (Optional) Script for checking the status of a song generation request.
